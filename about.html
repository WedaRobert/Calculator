        <h2>About the Scientific Calculator</h2>
        <p>This scientific calculator is designed to handle a variety of mathematical functions, including basic arithmetic, trigonometric functions, logarithms, and more. Here are some tips on how to use it:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Basic Operations:</strong> Use the buttons for addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/).</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced Functions:</strong> Use the buttons for square root (√), exponentiation (^), logarithms (log, ln), and trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan).</li>
            <li><strong>Parentheses:</strong> Use parentheses to group operations and control the order of calculations.</li>
            <li><strong>Clear and Backspace:</strong> Use the 'C' button to clear the display and the '←' button to delete the last character.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Here are some random and interesting facts about scientific calculators: </h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Origins in the 1960s:</strong>The first scientific calculators were developed in the late 1960s, with Hewlett-Packard (HP) introducing the HP-9100A in 1968. It was one of the earliest machines capable of performing trigonometric and logarithmic calculations.</li>
        <li><strong>HP-35: The First Handheld:</strong>In 1972, HP introduced the HP-35, the world’s first handheld scientific calculator. This innovation replaced the use of slide rules for engineers and scientists and became a game-changer in the industry.</li>
        <li><strong>Programmable Models: </strong>Many scientific calculators are programmable, allowing users to input sequences of operations or even write simple programs. These capabilities were a precursor to graphing calculators and modern handheld computers.</li>
